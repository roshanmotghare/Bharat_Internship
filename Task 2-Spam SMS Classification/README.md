# Summary

In this code, the author performs a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing email data, distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages. The primary steps include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), natural language processing (NLP), feature engineering, and model building. Here's a breakdown of the major components and techniques used:

### 1. **Data Import and Initial Exploration:**
- The code begins by importing necessary libraries, disabling warnings, and loading the dataset (`mail_data.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Initial exploration of the dataset includes checking for missing values, handling duplicates, and visualizing the distribution of spam and non-spam messages.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
- Renaming the column 'Message' to 'Text' for clarity.
- Creating a new column 'length' to store the length of each message.
- Visualizing the length distribution of ham and spam messages using both Seaborn and Plotly Express.

### 3. **NLP and Text Processing:**
- Utilizing NLTK for natural language processing tasks.
- Tokenizing, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing words.
- Creating word clouds to visualize the most frequent words in both ham and spam messages.

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Visualizing the distribution of ham and spam messages based on their lengths.
- Creating interactive histograms using Plotly Express for a detailed view of the length distribution.

### 5. **Feature Engineering:**
- Converting the 'Category' column to numerical values (0 for spam, 1 for ham).
- Utilizing CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer for text feature extraction.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 6. **Model Building:**
- Implementing various machine learning models:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - LightGBM Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - CatBoost Classifier
  - Voting Classifier combining multiple models
- Evaluating models using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, recall, and F1 score.

### 7. **Neural Network (LSTM) Model:**
- Building and training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for text classification.
- Using Tokenizer for text encoding and embedding layers for word representation.
- Evaluating the neural network model and comparing its performance with other machine learning models.

### 8. **Cross-Validation:**
- Employing stratified k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance robustness.

### 9. **Visualization of Model Performance:**
- Creating bar plots to visualize the evaluation metrics (accuracy, AUC, recall, F1) for different models and the neural network.
- Employing Plotly Express for interactive visualization.

### 10. **Ensemble Learning:**
- Creating a Voting Classifier by combining selected models to improve overall performance.

### 11. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation:**
- Utilizing confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the models.
- Comparing and summarizing the metrics for each model.
